# Script on SQL Using 311           #
# Purpose: Apply SQL concepts to 311#
#-----------------------------------#

# Please complete the following tasks:

# Question 1. 
# Create a new SQL database with 311 data called con311
# Create a master table called master

# Question 2. 
# Count the number of distinct service calls

# Question 3. 
# Determine what status a call can take

# Question 4. 
# Determine the number of service calls by status

# Question 5. 
# Find the minimum and maximum expected service dates if the 
# expected service date is not blank (Hint: keyword is "blank"). 
# What do we notice about this metric?

# Question 6. 
# Does zipcode look like a reliable field? Why or why not?

# Question 7. 
# Find the number of service calls for the zip codes 19104 and 19103 only. 

# Question 8. 
# Create a new table of distinct service codes and services names called service. 
# Are some services missing codes? How can we check these codes are indeed blank?

# Question 9. 
# Create a new table based on distinct service call ids, agencies, and service names. 
# Imagine this being your abbreviated master table. 

# Question 10. 
# Using the agency and service tables alone, provide a count of the number of 
# information requests each agency receives using the service code "SR-IR01" 
# (Hint: think about what would be helpful to do in SQL and what would be
# helpful to do in R.)
